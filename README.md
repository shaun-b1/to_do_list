# To-Do List

Welcome to the To-Do List project! This is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help users keep track of their tasks and manage their to-do lists. I undertook this project as part of the [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, as a way to solidify my understanding of OOP principles in JavaScript, and work with the language more before diving into using APIs and testing.

## Features

- **Add and Remove Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list and remove tasks once they are completed.
- **Task Management:** Tasks can be marked as completed, edited, or deleted as needed.
- **Local Storage:** The to-do list data is stored locally in the browser, allowing users to access their tasks even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## Usage

To use the To-Do List application, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can add new tasks by typing in the input field and pressing Enter. Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on the checkbox, edited by double-clicking on the task text, and deleted by clicking on the delete button.

## Installation

You don't need to install anything to use the To-Do List application. Just clone or download this repository to your local machine and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaun-b1/to_do_list.git
